# CustomBanlistCreator
Features
- This tool was created for YGOOmega and deployed to the Duelist Unit team. It's used to create custom banlists that the player can customize!
- Players can access the tool from any web browser. Add the cards they like and choose the limitation for each then generate the new banlist. 
- Templates: The tool provides you with an existing template of the most recent banlists (TCG, OCG, GOAT, etc..) and you will be able to
customize/modify that template!
- Import: The tool allows you to import an existing banlist (.conf file) and then modify it! 
- You can ban specific cards by name which means that the tool will use Yu-Gi-Oh! APi to fetch a list of cards and give you the ability to search
for a specific card and add it to the banlist.
- The cards you add to the list can be banned (limitation :0, 1, 2, 3) or even requirment (0, 1 ,2 ,3) and by requirment we mean that its required
for that card/item to be in the list. 
- You can ban/add a group of cards instead of an inidividual one by name, though, in this tool you can by by Card Type, Archetype, Category and etc..
- You can also enable the "DeckSize" which will allow you to restrict the number of cards in the deck into a specific number you choose. 
- An optional input is the "Location" which let you choose the place where the card(s)/item should be (Main, Extra, Side, main or extra and so on).
- You'll find a full-guide that will introduce to the tool and how to use it to create your own banlists!


Guide
- Should be added soon (as a video, or images, text or all-in-one) as we complete testing our tool making sure its ready to production!
